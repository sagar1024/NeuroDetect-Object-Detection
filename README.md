## ðŸ“– About the Project

### Problem Statement
Object detection and tracking are critical components in computer vision with applications ranging from surveillance systems to industrial automation. However, existing tools often lack user-friendly interfaces and require significant technical expertise to operate.

### How This Project Solves It
This project offers:
1. **Ease of Use**: A clean, intuitive dashboard for uploading videos or images, selecting object classes to detect, and visualizing results.
2. **Real-Time Analytics**: Displays detection results, including bounding boxes, class labels, and counts.
3. **Interactivity**: Provides options to download detection data for further analysis, making it ideal for users without extensive technical knowledge.

## ðŸ›  How the Project Works

#### Image Mode:

Upload an image file.

Perform object detection for selected classes.

Visualize results directly on the dashboard.

#### Video Mode:

Upload a video file.

Select object classes and confidence threshold from the sidebar.

View detections in real-time, with bounding boxes drawn on detected objects.

Download detection data as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Dashboard Features:

Real-time visualizations of detected objects.

Interactive charts and download options for detection statistics.

## ðŸ’¡ Challenges Faced and How We Overcame Them

1. Video Playback Issues:
Initially faced problems with autoplay functionality for embedded videos. Resolved by converting the demo video to a GIF and using st.image for seamless playback.

2. Handling Large Files:
Uploading large videos/images caused performance lags. Mitigated this by resizing input files dynamically using OpenCV.

3. Real-Time Detection Rendering:
Streamlit's default rendering posed challenges for displaying real-time detections. Solved this by leveraging Streamlit's st.image and efficiently updating frames.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Enhancements

1. Add support for additional object detection models.

2. Enable real-time webcam feed for live detections.

3. Expand analytics capabilities with more advanced visualization tools.
